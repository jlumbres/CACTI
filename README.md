# CACTI

The Coronagraphic Adaptiove optics Comprehensive Testbed Instrument (CACTI) is an experimental testbed in the Extreme Wavefront Control Laboratory at The University of Arizona. This repository will feature optial surface metrology using power spectrum density and Fresnel propagation simulation for modeling CACTI.

Modular code is in another repository, when I get around to linking it correctly.

For optical surface maps, contact me (jlumbres@optics.arizona.edu) so I can send the Google Drive link.
